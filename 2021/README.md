This is a directory with my solutions to 2021's [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

There are two solutions for every puzzle:

- One written in Rust to keep my knowledge of the language somewhat fresh (you can find those in the `rust` directory).
- Another written in Julia because I wanted to learn its syntax and play with it a bit (you can find those in the `julia` directory). Since I had no prior knowledge of Julia before writing these solutions, these solutions are likely very messy, far from idiomatic, and likely not using the full power of Julia.

Every solution was first written in Rust. The Julia solutions are a rough attempt of porting the Rust solutions.

The year of the Zig!

Note: it looks like my run was cut short after day 13, since Advent of Code decided to block traffic from VPNs. This goes against my principles and makes it way more annoying to use advent of code from my dev machine, so I decided not to continue solving the puzzles. I might revisit this later. In any case, it already did its job to allow me to get some first-hand experience with Zig, and more importantly be able to read, understand, and work with Zig code.
